I’ve been so busy that these posts get missed. Too many projects. Dealing with sinus issues that leave me unfocused and mentally slow. Too much effort to get through the required work and so these posts get ignored. So it goes.\nReviewing the past couple of weeks and there’s not much to share. I’ve had my head down working on stuff. Clipped a ton of stuff for future review. That’s my work for the upcoming week.\nI built a post of places where you can build an online identity. These are the quick home landing pages that you can use to link out to your various online channels. Think of these as your online business card. You can use these as the link in your bio or email signature.\nOtherwise, here are a few interesting quotes that I clipped recently…\n\nDystopian fiction is when you take things that happen in real life to marginalized populations and apply them to people with privilege.\n— H Book Club blog\n\n\nOne of the surest tests [of the superiority or inferiority of a poet] is the way in which a poet borrows. Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion. A good poet will usually borrow from authors remote in time, or alien in language, or diverse in interest.\n— T.S. Eliot"

    "text": "week 4 of 2024\n\n\n\n\nWill Toulan creates these interesting AI generated artworks that fascinate me with their surreal nostalgic vibe. This captures my mindspace this past week.\n\nIt was a random and disconnected week for me. My attention has been on deeper surreal connections that feel more abstract and unrelated. I think I’ve enjoyed the randomness although I kept fighting the urge to force things into a more focused and productive mindset. Seems like I felt the need to have something tangible to show for these subconscious dives. Thankfully, I remembered that it is all about the journey and not the destination. I don’t need to do anything but enjoy the adventure for what it is even if it is all in my head and I don’t have anything to show for it. Deep work is being done even if it doesn’t feel like it.\nI think the finds I have this week reflect my disconnected mindset and my own attempts at finding meaning.\n\nWorking on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable. Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes, experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what makes the journey enjoyable.\n— Manu Moreale\n\n\n\ndisconnection and ambiguity\nApophenia is the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things. It is the ability to connect dots that others do not see. Originally meant as an indicator of early stages of schizophrenia or other psychiatric dysfunction. I believe it can also be a sign of intelligence and creativity as shown through pattern recognition and a sense of synchronicity.\n\n…creativity is the opposite of certainty. When you’re creating, you’re making something that hasn’t been done before, and to do that, there isn’t a set path with clear yeses and noes. You have to be willing to step into the unknown if you want to be creative.\n— Ida Perrson\n\nThis is an idea that has resonated with me for years, especially as design teacher. Students are so used to being told what to do that they struggle mightily when the job is to create their own path. There’s a ton of fear in the unknown and it takes bravery to willingly take that step.\nMy (unfinished) masters thesis was all about dealing with uncertainty and helping students work through that challenge. I have tons of notes, thoughts, links related to uncertainty and yet there’s not much on my website yet. Rediscovering the idea this week has renewed my interest in organizing those thoughts.\n\n\n\nfunctionality of design\n\nMinimalist design can be expressed in many forms. It can be almost anything we use. The difference between art and design is simple: design needs to work — art does not.\n— minimalism.com\n\n\n\nslow vs fast\nContrast the idea of Slow Design and the idea of taking time to test, iterate, explore and refine coupled with patience and mindful craftsmanship with the need to Design For Speed where users expect everything to work quickly and accurately without fail. Designers need to take their time creating things/tools/experiences that can be used quickly and without thought. The two concepts are intertwined.\n\nSlow design is about embracing the time-consuming process of trial and error so we can figure out the most elegant, considered, and sustainable solution…Design is not just about the end product. It’s the journey that design has taken to be visualised, prototyped, iterated upon, tested, fine-tuned, and realised.\n— Carl Barenbrug\n\n\nPeople expect a response in a certain amount of time, otherwise things get weird. The same can be said with peoples’ expectations of software. When they click a link, they expect the page to load within a certain amount of time. When they tap a button, they expect an immediate response. Otherwise things get weird.\n— PJ Onori\n\n\ngenerative.fm is a site with ambient music generators that are truly random and don’t repeat. There are a ton of recipes on the site with categories like calm, drone, and electronic. I’m currently listening to Skyline. Added this link to my ambient sounds page."

I live in the middle of nowhere so there are only a few pages near where I live. I work in Lansing, Michigan and there are about 150 pages near where I work. It is a fun and interesting way to explore your neighborhood.\nDaft Social is an anti-social network where you post by sending an email and only the email subject line is published. You can share short snippets of text, links, or images this way. The official Daft Social feed is pretty minimal and fun to read.\nFull-Stack Personal Development by Anne-Laure Le Cunff at Ness Labs is a fun metaphor for understanding this funny thing called life. As a digital designer, the concept resonated with me. It looks at front-end public skills like Collaboration and Leadership coupled with back-end private skills like Metacognition and Self-Regulation. It is all about personal development couched in the language of building a web app. Reminds me of the article Life is a Video Game article by Mark Manson with cheat codes on how to play the game of life well.\n\nA callback to what I posted last week about the combination of slow and fast design. I’m noticing a trend here that I should probably pay more attention to.\n\nI believe speed is important. But I also believe that months of continuous pondering can produce an insight that lights the way for months to come. I understand the argument for shipping early and often. But I also believe that we should aspire to build lovable products, not viable products. And lovable products take time to build and polish.\n— Sari Azout"

    "text": "week 6 of 2024\n\n\n\n\ntom dearie creates interesting creatures and environments for them to live in.\n\n\nTo achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan and not quite enough time.\n— Leonard Bernstein\n\n\n\ncreativity and depression\nI discovered Winnie Lim this week through Manuel Moreale’s ongoing series People & Blogs. Her writing about depression and creativity and working through challenges resonated deeply with me. I love how open and expressive she is about growing and learning and living life as openly as possible. Comes back to that idea of learning in public.\nA few quotes that struck a chord…\n\nIn most cases of learning something, there is bound to be phases where we feel dumb, slow, and as though nothing ever happens like no progress is being made. We have to fumble, keep making mistakes, keep having to repeat the same steps over and over again.\n— Winnie Lim\n\n\nLife can feel extremely heavy and to be able to be amused is a form of aliveness.\n— Winnie Lim\n\n\n\n\nindie web\nI’ve been exploring random stops on the internet information super-highway since the early 90s. I miss the exuberant feeling that there were cool people making neat things and sharing them with the rest of the world. Those were the days before the mega-platforms and social media algorithms that control what everyone sees and shares. It makes me happy to see that there seems to be a resurgence of indie sites and personal expression these days. At least it feels like that in the places on the web where I tend to wander.\nI rediscovered the ooh.directory this week. Tons of independent blogs related to all sorts of different topics. Many pleasant breaks in my days making stops in random web-places. Already had the ooh.directory on my list of graphic design resources.\nSimilarly, the forest is good for finding random websites to explore. Hit the button and go somewhere random. For more silliness, check out the useless web.\n\n\n\nEminem’s visual work\nAs we all know, Eminem is a true master of rhymes. I loved seeing his boxes filled with pages of scribbled rhyme explorations. It looks chaotic but there’s a structure and pattern to his work. I’ll be sharing this as an exemplar of creative process with my students this week. I’ll also be adding personal anecdotes of seeing him perform in Detroit clubs back in the 90s before he made it big. He was just another guy out there doing his thing and it was cool to see.\n\n\n\nfun random thing\nPong Wars is great fun to watch. The eternal battle between night and day played out in Pong. Good meditative experience."

Good adventures with fellow counterparts that understood what I do at a fundamental level. Outstanding conversations. Took a lot of time and mental bandwidth though. Feels like I don’t have much content for the post this week. So it goes.\n\n\nart effects using photoshop generative fill\nAt the convention I learned about an interesting technique for using Generative Fill in Photoshop to create interesting art effects from a base image. Can even use a blank document to get Photoshop to generate the base image. I’ve had a blast experimenting with different images and prompts.\nI found this tutorial by Nicolesy that gives plenty of examples of what different prompts will look like.\n\n\nOf course, since it is using AI to generate the effects, your mileage will vary. I’m having fun stacking multiple layers and playing with how different effects interact. Adjusting the hell out of things as well. Feels like I’m doing something more personal than letting the computer do all the work.\n\nArtists are people who are profoundly compelled to make their creative work, and when they are distanced from their practice, their life quality suffers.\n— Beth Pickens\n\nPlaying around visually is putting me in a better mood than I’ve been in a long time. I love being an art educator and meta-thinking about my teaching practice, however I miss having time to play around with pictures. My experiments aren’t really feeling like art yet but it does feel good to be playing.\n\nThe advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who’ll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work.\nAll the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things occur to you. If you’re sitting around trying to dream up a great idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that’s almost never the case.\n— Chuck Close\n\n\n\n\nanother creative source to explore\nFound another trove of interesting creative productivty inspiration from sari on Sublime. No time to explore now but adding it to the list for some unknown future when I will have time.\n\n\n\nfeeling old\nAnd then there is this. I’m feeling old and slow this weekend after all the adventures. Nice to have time to be slow and quiet.\n\n\njenny lawson"

Going to curate a list of the neat things I find over the course of a week and share it on the website. Hoping to build a habit of weekly reviews of what I did and what I learned. Building this gives me a chance to organize the randomness I find. Cool.\n\n\ninspiration stuff\n\nGodly Website for website inspiration. I need to add this to my web inspiration sites collection.\n\n\n\ncolor stuff\n\nGradienmood lets you enter a prompt and it generates a css gradient for you. I need to add this to my web gradients collection.\n\n\n\nopen source icons and font stuff\nI’m a huge fan of open source resources. Love the idea of people making stuff and sharing with the world. Stumbled upon a few new sources this week.\n\nAtlas icons open source icons\nGlyphs.FYI open source icons through figma\nDoodle Icons from Khushmeen open source doodle icons for a more sketchy look\nOnest open source sans-serif workhorse font representing Moldova\nOpen source fonts you’ll actually love from webdesigner depot\n\nSpeaking of fonts, House Industries type foundry has some amazing faces for a relatively affordable price.\n\n\nThe edge is in the inputs.\nThe person who consumes from better sources, gets better thoughts. The person who asks better questions, gets better answers. The person who builds better habits, gets better results.\nIt’s not the outcomes. It’s the inputs.\n— James Clear\n\nThis resonated with me this week. Upgrade your inputs and that will help with your outputs. Reminds me of the opposite phrase from computer science: “garbage in, garbage out”. I’ve been trying to focus closer on what content I’m consuming and curating lately. Mostly, I’m trying to balance my time between developing and teaching classes and working on exploring content. Since my time is limited, I have to pay attention to my sources. Still figuring this out.\n\nFinally, a big find for me personally: glasp is a browser plugin for highlighting and noting web content. Information is publicly shared in an online community. Can easily convert the highlights and notes into markdown for obsidian so I don’t necessarily need to capture full content from a website. I think this is going to be an interesting and productive step in my collection and curation process. Can’t wait to see how my own workflow changes with the addition of this tool.\nHere is my public glasp. Not much there yet, of course, but expect it will be filling in quite a bit soon enough."

Even though I teach Adobe products, I prefer using Affinity products in my own work.\n\nI was busy last weekend with project and didn’t get the post put together. That’s fine. I knew I would probably be inconsistent with these things. Plus, for now, I’m pretty sure I’m the only aware of these things even existing. Nothing wrong with that, these are mostly for me anyway.\nI’m having fun combing through the last few weeks of clipped content and saved bookmarks. There is a lot of good stuff here. Some of this would probably have gotten lost if I hadn’t taken the time to go back through and organize them. See, there is a purpose to this project. Cool.\n\n\nso, I made something\nThis is an embed of something you will find over on my art journal. There’s a convenient link to jump over there to see what else I’ve been up to, if you are so inclined.\nSeems like I rarely find the time to make something these days. It isn’t much, just a new approach to my links homepage. The challenge was to build a sliding page with scroll-snap for each section. There’s a persistent navigation list to each section. It isn’t much and I probably won’t continue using it, but, still, fun to have made something interesting.\nHere’s the colored version:\n\n\nHere’s the minimal version. Think I like this one better:\n\n\n\n\n\nweb design stuff\nSpeaking of web design, a good reminder that front-end is so much more than building designs by Andy Bell. Such a fun trip down nostalgia-lane with web design mockups built in Photoshop and then hacked together in code. His breakdown of the process of mapping things out and writing semantic markup is extremely similar to how I go about putting together a functional page.\nAlso, Every Layout seems quite intriguing. It is a system (maybe) for writing good clean code that utilizes the power of the browsers. There are free rudiments and axioms to start with and a full package for $69. I dig the bold minimal style of the site.\nThe Neurodiversity Design System is a set of principles for building websites that support neurodivergent learners. Good collection of simple rules to help with accessibility, which helps everyone, not just neurodivergent users.\n\n\n\nother design stuff\nThere are plenty of color scheme generators out there. Palette Pro is the newest one that I’ve found. It is powerfully simple and clean. It works pretty well too.\nVisual design rules you can safely follow every time from Anthony Hobday is a good set of notes on how to create functional design elements. It is focused on web design but the concepts work perfectly well with print as well. He has other interesting side projects that I will be exploring very soon. Many of these resonate strongly with me.\n\n\n\nstuff i want to dig into deeper\nCreativity as a system by Kazden Cattapan is the sort of thing I really like thinking about. My interests always seem to fall back to the nuances of the creative process. I haven’t incorporated these ideas into my maps of concepts yet but will be diving in soon…I hope.\nLab Notes by Alexander Obenauer is a collection of thoughts and processes related to personal computing and the “operating system of the future”. So many good things related to computer science but also how we use our technology. The site is pretty well designed too.\nSpline looks to be an intriguing 3D modeling app that marries collaboration and functional tools together into an easy to use system. I’m currently teaching 3D modeling using the overwhelmingly complex beast known as Autodesk Maya. I like these smaller projects moving the tools forward in simpler ways. You aren’t going to make Avatar with this but you might still be able to create cool interactive pieces for web or an app.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisual inspiration\nThis Geometric Primes series of posters by Nicholas Rougeux is so visually captivating. He’s working with a simple mathematical setup to create neat visual forms. The ordered approach satisfies my designer side and the visual variations make my artist side happy.\n\n\nNicholas has so many more exceedingly cool projects on his site. Many projects have posters you can order. If only I had the money and wallspace to buy all of them.\nI find the softly surreal images of Lucas Burtin to be captivating. That’s about it.\n\n\n\n\ni think we’ve all had days like these.\n\n\n\nrandom fun web experiments\nI love the Wonders of Street View from Neal.Fun. Just hit the Random button in the upper-right corner and you will be taken to some interesting place on Google Street View. In five minutes, I’ve visited melting houses, a hut in Antarctica, a bear eating fish in Russia, and a giant chest of drawers in North Carolina.\nHere’s a colored pencil fence from Poland.\n\n\n\n\nsimple little thing but now i want to go back to poland, just to see this.\nOne I’ve used in the past, but recently rediscovered: radio.garden. It is a giant spinning globe with hotspot links to streaming radio stations around the world. A simple click and you can be listening to techno in Berlin or zen music from Japan. The interface is pretty awesome too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstations along the east coast and midwest of the united states."

The written portion is quite entertaining with terms like “esoteric knowledge” and “mystical witchcraft” and “arcane arts of color”. Works pretty well as a color palette generator too.\n\n\n\nZara Picken creates cool paper-cutout illustrations. They are actually digital vector illustrations but still look completely like layered pieces of paper. Very cool style.\nA side project of hers called the Modern Illustration Archive lets you explore illustration and graphic design through the decades from 1940s through 1970s. Can also explore specific formats like beer coasters and playing cards. Not a ton of images but still fun to wander through.\n\n\n\nThe Manifold Garden video game came out a few years ago but it flew under the radar. I picked up a copy for sale on Epic for a couple of bucks. It is an amazing interactive experience where you rotate in space, turning walls into floors and windows into holes in the floor. My sense of spatial understanding is pretty good but this thing is turning me sideways on a regular basis. It has been a long time since I’ve enjoyed a game this much.\n\n\n\nDavid Romero has been creating photorealistic renderings of unbuilt Frank Lloyd Wright designs. Great attention to detail. Some of these designs feel like they could also exist in Manifold Garden. I guess that means the garden was partially inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. Then again, many designers have been inspired by Wright’s work over the years. David Romero has also been rendering some of Wright’s unbuilt skyscrapers.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of 3D experiences, Adobe has a new interactive website out called Taking Shape that highlights the powers of Adobe Substance. It has been a year or so since Adobe bought the Substance Suite and they are really leaning heavily into 3D. Great visual examples, interviews, and process shots of what is possible with the tools.\nI can see this site winning people over. We are actually considering migrating from Autodesk Maya to Adobe Substance 3D where I teach visual design. My 3D students thought it was cool, although they are studying to do this stuff professionally so they are a bit biased.\n\nrandom creativity quote with no explanation…\n\nWe tend to think of the artist’s work as the output.

If a person is suffering, then they’re creating in spite of that, not because of that.\n—David Lynch\n\n\n…everyone wants to succeed immediately and without pain or effort. Or they love to write books about how to write books, rather than actually writing…a book that might actually be about something. Bad advice is everywhere. Build a following. Establish a platform. Learn how to scam the system. In other words, do all the surface stuff and none of the real work it takes to actually produce something of value. The disease of our times is that we live on the surface. We’re like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep. Real work and real satisfaction comes from the opposite of what the web provides. they come from going deep into something – the book you’re writing, the album, the movie – and staying there for a long, long, time.\n— Steven Pressfield"

Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion. A good poet will usually borrow from authors remote in time, or alien in language, or diverse in interest.\n— T.S. Eliot"

As a digital designer, the concept resonated with me. It looks at front-end public skills like Collaboration and Leadership coupled with back-end private skills like Metacognition and Self-Regulation. It is all about personal development couched in the language of building a web app. Reminds me of the article Life is a Video Game article by Mark Manson with cheat codes on how to play the game of life well.\n\nA callback to what I posted last week about the combination of slow and fast design. I’m noticing a trend here that I should probably pay more attention to.\n\nI believe speed is important. But I also believe that months of continuous pondering can produce an insight that lights the way for months to come. I understand the argument for shipping early and often. But I also believe that we should aspire to build lovable products, not viable products. And lovable products take time to build and polish.\n— Sari Azout"

    "text": "week 4 of 2024\n\n\n\n\nWill Toulan creates these interesting AI generated artworks that fascinate me with their surreal nostalgic vibe. This captures my mindspace this past week.\n\nIt was a random and disconnected week for me. My attention has been on deeper surreal connections that feel more abstract and unrelated. I think I’ve enjoyed the randomness although I kept fighting the urge to force things into a more focused and productive mindset. Seems like I felt the need to have something tangible to show for these subconscious dives. Thankfully, I remembered that it is all about the journey and not the destination. I don’t need to do anything but enjoy the adventure for what it is even if it is all in my head and I don’t have anything to show for it. Deep work is being done even if it doesn’t feel like it.\nI think the finds I have this week reflect my disconnected mindset and my own attempts at finding meaning.\n\nWorking on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable. Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes, experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what makes the journey enjoyable.\n— Manu Moreale\n\n\n\ndisconnection and ambiguity\nApophenia is the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things. It is the ability to connect dots that others do not see. Originally meant as an indicator of early stages of schizophrenia or other psychiatric dysfunction. I believe it can also be a sign of intelligence and creativity as shown through pattern recognition and a sense of synchronicity.\n\n…creativity is the opposite of certainty. When you’re creating, you’re making something that hasn’t been done before, and to do that, there isn’t a set path with clear yeses and noes. You have to be willing to step into the unknown if you want to be creative.\n— Ida Perrson\n\nThis is an idea that has resonated with me for years, especially as design teacher. Students are so used to being told what to do that they struggle mightily when the job is to create their own path. There’s a ton of fear in the unknown and it takes bravery to willingly take that step.\nMy (unfinished) masters thesis was all about dealing with uncertainty and helping students work through that challenge. I have tons of notes, thoughts, links related to uncertainty and yet there’s not much on my website yet. Rediscovering the idea this week has renewed my interest in organizing those thoughts.\n\n\n\nfunctionality of design\n\nMinimalist design can be expressed in many forms. It can be almost anything we use. The difference between art and design is simple: design needs to work — art does not.\n— minimalism.com\n\n\n\nslow vs fast\nContrast the idea of Slow Design and the idea of taking time to test, iterate, explore and refine coupled with patience and mindful craftsmanship with the need to Design For Speed where users expect everything to work quickly and accurately without fail. Designers need to take their time creating things/tools/experiences that can be used quickly and without thought. The two concepts are intertwined.\n\nSlow design is about embracing the time-consuming process of trial and error so we can figure out the most elegant, considered, and sustainable solution…Design is not just about the end product. It’s the journey that design has taken to be visualised, prototyped, iterated upon, tested, fine-tuned, and realised.\n— Carl Barenbrug\n\n\nPeople expect a response in a certain amount of time, otherwise things get weird. The same can be said with peoples’ expectations of software. When they click a link, they expect the page to load within a certain amount of time. When they tap a button, they expect an immediate response. Otherwise things get weird.\n— PJ Onori\n\n\ngenerative.fm is a site with ambient music generators that are truly random and don’t repeat. There are a ton of recipes on the site with categories like calm, drone, and electronic. I’m currently listening to Skyline. Added this link to my ambient sounds page."

    "text": "week 7 of 2024\n\n\n\n\nillustrations generated with photoshop generative fill techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpent a good chunk of this week at an education convention spending time with fellow CTE design teachers as we built the new state standards for our programs. Good adventures with fellow counterparts that understood what I do at a fundamental level. Outstanding conversations. Took a lot of time and mental bandwidth though. Feels like I don’t have much content for the post this week. So it goes.\n\n\nart effects using photoshop generative fill\nAt the convention I learned about an interesting technique for using Generative Fill in Photoshop to create interesting art effects from a base image. Can even use a blank document to get Photoshop to generate the base image. I’ve had a blast experimenting with different images and prompts.\nI found this tutorial by Nicolesy that gives plenty of examples of what different prompts will look like.\n\n\nOf course, since it is using AI to generate the effects, your mileage will vary. I’m having fun stacking multiple layers and playing with how different effects interact. Adjusting the hell out of things as well. Feels like I’m doing something more personal than letting the computer do all the work.\n\nArtists are people who are profoundly compelled to make their creative work, and when they are distanced from their practice, their life quality suffers.\n— Beth Pickens\n\nPlaying around visually is putting me in a better mood than I’ve been in a long time. I love being an art educator and meta-thinking about my teaching practice, however I miss having time to play around with pictures. My experiments aren’t really feeling like art yet but it does feel good to be playing.\n\nThe advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who’ll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work.\nAll the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things occur to you. If you’re sitting around trying to dream up a great idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that’s almost never the case.\n— Chuck Close\n\n\n\n\nanother creative source to explore\nFound another trove of interesting creative productivty inspiration from sari on Sublime. No time to explore now but adding it to the list for some unknown future when I will have time.\n\n\n\nfeeling old\nAnd then there is this. I’m feeling old and slow this weekend after all the adventures. Nice to have time to be slow and quiet.\n\n\njenny lawson"

I love how open and expressive she is about growing and learning and living life as openly as possible. Comes back to that idea of learning in public.\nA few quotes that struck a chord…\n\nIn most cases of learning something, there is bound to be phases where we feel dumb, slow, and as though nothing ever happens like no progress is being made.

I miss the exuberant feeling that there were cool people making neat things and sharing them with the rest of the world. Those were the days before the mega-platforms and social media algorithms that control what everyone sees and shares. It makes me happy to see that there seems to be a resurgence of indie sites and personal expression these days. At least it feels like that in the places on the web where I tend to wander.\nI rediscovered the ooh.directory this week. Tons of independent blogs related to all sorts of different topics. Many pleasant breaks in my days making stops in random web-places. Already had the ooh.directory on my list of graphic design resources.\nSimilarly, the forest is good for finding random websites to explore. Hit the button and go somewhere random. For more silliness, check out the useless web.\n\n\n\nEminem’s visual work\nAs we all know, Eminem is a true master of rhymes. I loved seeing his boxes filled with pages of scribbled rhyme explorations. It looks chaotic but there’s a structure and pattern to his work. I’ll be sharing this as an exemplar of creative process with my students this week. I’ll also be adding personal anecdotes of seeing him perform in Detroit clubs back in the 90s before he made it big. He was just another guy out there doing his thing and it was cool to see.\n\n\n\nfun random thing\nPong Wars is great fun to watch. The eternal battle between night and day played out in Pong.

Reminds me of the opposite phrase from computer science: “garbage in, garbage out”. I’ve been trying to focus closer on what content I’m consuming and curating lately. Mostly, I’m trying to balance my time between developing and teaching classes and working on exploring content. Since my time is limited, I have to pay attention to my sources. Still figuring this out.\n\nFinally, a big find for me personally: glasp is a browser plugin for highlighting and noting web content. Information is publicly shared in an online community. Can easily convert the highlights and notes into markdown for obsidian so I don’t necessarily need to capture full content from a website. I think this is going to be an interesting and productive step in my collection and curation process. Can’t wait to see how my own workflow changes with the addition of this tool.\nHere is my public glasp. Not much there yet, of course, but expect it will be filling in quite a bit soon enough."

Even though I teach Adobe products, I prefer using Affinity products in my own work.\n\nI was busy last weekend with project and didn’t get the post put together. That’s fine. I knew I would probably be inconsistent with these things. Plus, for now, I’m pretty sure I’m the only aware of these things even existing. Nothing wrong with that, these are mostly for me anyway.\nI’m having fun combing through the last few weeks of clipped content and saved bookmarks. There is a lot of good stuff here. Some of this would probably have gotten lost if I hadn’t taken the time to go back through and organize them. See, there is a purpose to this project. Cool.\n\n\nso, I made something\nThis is an embed of something you will find over on my art journal. There’s a convenient link to jump over there to see what else I’ve been up to, if you are so inclined.\nSeems like I rarely find the time to make something these days. It isn’t much, just a new approach to my links homepage. The challenge was to build a sliding page with scroll-snap for each section. There’s a persistent navigation list to each section. It isn’t much and I probably won’t continue using it, but, still, fun to have made something interesting.\nHere’s the colored version:\n\n\nHere’s the minimal version. Think I like this one better:\n\n\n\n\n\nweb design stuff\nSpeaking of web design, a good reminder that front-end is so much more than building designs by Andy Bell. Such a fun trip down nostalgia-lane with web design mockups built in Photoshop and then hacked together in code. His breakdown of the process of mapping things out and writing semantic markup is extremely similar to how I go about putting together a functional page.\nAlso, Every Layout seems quite intriguing. It is a system (maybe) for writing good clean code that utilizes the power of the browsers. There are free rudiments and axioms to start with and a full package for $69. I dig the bold minimal style of the site.\nThe Neurodiversity Design System is a set of principles for building websites that support neurodivergent learners. Good collection of simple rules to help with accessibility, which helps everyone, not just neurodivergent users.\n\n\n\nother design stuff\nThere are plenty of color scheme generators out there. Palette Pro is the newest one that I’ve found. It is powerfully simple and clean. It works pretty well too.\nVisual design rules you can safely follow every time from Anthony Hobday is a good set of notes on how to create functional design elements. It is focused on web design but the concepts work perfectly well with print as well. He has other interesting side projects that I will be exploring very soon. Many of these resonate strongly with me.\n\n\n\nstuff i want to dig into deeper\nCreativity as a system by Kazden Cattapan is the sort of thing I really like thinking about. My interests always seem to fall back to the nuances of the creative process. I haven’t incorporated these ideas into my maps of concepts yet but will be diving in soon…I hope.\nLab Notes by Alexander Obenauer is a collection of thoughts and processes related to personal computing and the “operating system of the future”. So many good things related to computer science but also how we use our technology. The site is pretty well designed too.\nSpline looks to be an intriguing 3D modeling app that marries collaboration and functional tools together into an easy to use system. I’m currently teaching 3D modeling using the overwhelmingly complex beast known as Autodesk Maya. I like these smaller projects moving the tools forward in simpler ways. You aren’t going to make Avatar with this but you might still be able to create cool interactive pieces for web or an app.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisual inspiration\nThis Geometric Primes series of posters by Nicholas Rougeux is so visually captivating.

The written portion is quite entertaining with terms like “esoteric knowledge” and “mystical witchcraft” and “arcane arts of color”. Works pretty well as a color palette generator too.\n\n\n\nZara Picken creates cool paper-cutout illustrations. They are actually digital vector illustrations but still look completely like layered pieces of paper. Very cool style.\nA side project of hers called the Modern Illustration Archive lets you explore illustration and graphic design through the decades from 1940s through 1970s. Can also explore specific formats like beer coasters and playing cards. Not a ton of images but still fun to wander through.\n\n\n\nThe Manifold Garden video game came out a few years ago but it flew under the radar. I picked up a copy for sale on Epic for a couple of bucks. It is an amazing interactive experience where you rotate in space, turning walls into floors and windows into holes in the floor. My sense of spatial understanding is pretty good but this thing is turning me sideways on a regular basis. It has been a long time since I’ve enjoyed a game this much.\n\n\n\nDavid Romero has been creating photorealistic renderings of unbuilt Frank Lloyd Wright designs. Great attention to detail. Some of these designs feel like they could also exist in Manifold Garden. I guess that means the garden was partially inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. Then again, many designers have been inspired by Wright’s work over the years. David Romero has also been rendering some of Wright’s unbuilt skyscrapers.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of 3D experiences, Adobe has a new interactive website out called Taking Shape that highlights the powers of Adobe Substance. It has been a year or so since Adobe bought the Substance Suite and they are really leaning heavily into 3D. Great visual examples, interviews, and process shots of what is possible with the tools.\nI can see this site winning people over. We are actually considering migrating from Autodesk Maya to Adobe Substance 3D where I teach visual design. My 3D students thought it was cool, although they are studying to do this stuff professionally so they are a bit biased.\n\nrandom creativity quote with no explanation…\n\nWe tend to think of the artist’s work as the output. The real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.\n— Rick Rubin"

If a person is suffering, then they’re creating in spite of that, not because of that.\n—David Lynch\n\n\n…everyone wants to succeed immediately and without pain or effort. Or they love to write books about how to write books, rather than actually writing…a book that might actually be about something. Bad advice is everywhere. Build a following. Establish a platform. Learn how to scam the system. In other words, do all the surface stuff and none of the real work it takes to actually produce something of value. The disease of our times is that we live on the surface. We’re like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep. Real work and real satisfaction comes from the opposite of what the web provides. they come from going deep into something – the book you’re writing, the album, the movie – and staying there for a long, long, time.\n— Steven Pressfield"

They aren’t empty, by any means, but there’s a sense of loneliness and isolation that is somehow calming. Good reminder that both in art and life, we all need a bit of white space.\n\nI’ve been extremely busy the last several weeks with whole classes or marking periods coming to an end, school presentations and activities, snow days, and probably other stuff I can’t even remember. No surprise this neat things project got pushed down on the list of priorities. I knew things like this would happen. No big deal.\n\n\nconcepts\nSoft Fascination is a term that’s been catching my attention quite a lot lately. When you are focused on something that isn’t too mentally challenging, your attention can relax and drift. You are mindfully aware but not too connected. Think about how your mind can wander while taking a walk in the woods or sitting by a river. It is a relaxing experience that leads to new ideas and inspiration. You can’t force soft fascination but you can create the conditions in your life for it to arise naturally.\nWabi Sabi is the Japanese term for an appreciation for the beauty of impermanence and imperfection. It is a celebration of the natural world where things age, get broken and battered, show their scars and patina, and eventually fade away. There’s a shift from perfection toward worn and lived-in things, from slick mass-production to used and worn individuality. I’ve been aware of the concept for a long time but never really connected it to my need to add layers of texture and imperfections into my art. Most of what you find for Wabi Sabi relates to architecture and interior design, but I see connections with painting and graphic design as well. I’ve been collecting a bunch of resources, links, and videos to review and include on my site.\nOpen Culture has a wonderful history of Wabi Sabi on YouTube:\n\n\n\n\nRecharging is something I’m trying to do more of. I have a tendency to work too hard and too long which leads to mental exhaustion and burnout. I’m giving myself reminders to slow down and recharge. Some noticeable progress happening.\n\n\n\nquick links\n\nArtvee browse and download high-resolution, public domain artworks\nFree UI Resources for free stuff\nIconNoir free open source icons\nThe Visual Design Syllabus for all the things to learn as a visual designer\nShaun Tan makes really interesting and beautiful art\nCozy video games that feel like reading a book I’ve played several of these. I’m a sucker for interactive narrative experiences\nT-Shaped vs V-Shaped employees pretty sure I’m V-Shaped but not sure what to do with that knowledge\nSerendipity by Design is about finding ideas in new places. Ties quite well into both Wabi Sabi and Soft Fascination. I’ll probably be digging deeper here soon\n\n\n\n\nquotes\n\nIt’s rarely doing the work that is hard, it’s starting the work. Once you begin, it’s often less painful to continue working. This is why—in the beginning—it is often more important to build the habit of getting started than it is to worry about whether or not you are doing enough.\n— James Clear\n\nLike many creative people, I struggle with procrastination. I live comfortably in my head and often would rather spend time there thinking about interesting things. Sometimes you have to get out of your head and actually start doing the work that needs to be done. I know on a rational level from experience that you just need to get started with the work and that ideas will come while you are working. Sometimes I need to be reminded of that fact though.\n\nThe “if I had time” lie is a convenient way to ignore the fact that novels require being written and that writing happens a sentence at a time. Sentences can happen in a moment. Enough stolen moments, enough stolen sentences, and a novel is born — without the luxury of time.\n— Julia Cameron\n\nI wish I could find a way to make that happen, Julia, I really do. It takes me too long to get my brain working on something to just dip in and out between other things.\n\nWhen you need to learn quickly, learn from others.\nWhen you need to learn deeply, learn from experience.\n— James Clear\n\nYes! I’ve been leaning heavily on YouTube and the internet to quickly learn Maya in time to teach concepts to my students. This works great for getting started with just about any topic but you really need to do the work yourself to learn things in a deeply meaningful way. I need so much more time to really get lost in all the things I find interesting (and to make connections between them).\n\nAny observant local knows more than any visiting scientist. Always. No exceptions.\n— Roger Payne, Biologist\n\nWhen designing, trust the regular users who have an ongoing running experience with the product. They will always have the important insights the designers or even the bosses will ever have. Also, work with what you know."

Even though I teach Adobe products, I prefer using Affinity products in my own work.\n\nI was busy last weekend with project and didn’t get the post put together. That’s fine. I knew I would probably be inconsistent with these things. Plus, for now, I’m pretty sure I’m the only aware of these things even existing. Nothing wrong with that, these are mostly for me anyway.\nI’m having fun combing through the last few weeks of clipped content and saved bookmarks. There is a lot of good stuff here. Some of this would probably have gotten lost if I hadn’t taken the time to go back through and organize them. See, there is a purpose to this project. Cool.\n\n\nso, I made something\nThis is an embed of something you will find over on my art journal. There’s a convenient link to jump over there to see what else I’ve been up to, if you are so inclined.\nSeems like I rarely find the time to make something these days. It isn’t much, just a new approach to my links homepage. The challenge was to build a sliding page with scroll-snap for each section. There’s a persistent navigation list to each section. It isn’t much and I probably won’t continue using it, but, still, fun to have made something interesting.\nHere’s the colored version:\n\n\nHere’s the minimal version. Think I like this one better:\n\n\n\n\n\nweb design stuff\nSpeaking of web design, a good reminder that front-end is so much more than building designs by Andy Bell. Such a fun trip down nostalgia-lane with web design mockups built in Photoshop and then hacked together in code. His breakdown of the process of mapping things out and writing semantic markup is extremely similar to how I go about putting together a functional page.\nAlso, Every Layout seems quite intriguing. It is a system (maybe) for writing good clean code that utilizes the power of the browsers. There are free rudiments and axioms to start with and a full package for $69. I dig the bold minimal style of the site.\nThe Neurodiversity Design System is a set of principles for building websites that support neurodivergent learners. Good collection of simple rules to help with accessibility, which helps everyone, not just neurodivergent users.\n\n\n\nother design stuff\nThere are plenty of color scheme generators out there. Palette Pro is the newest one that I’ve found. It is powerfully simple and clean. It works pretty well too.\nVisual design rules you can safely follow every time from Anthony Hobday is a good set of notes on how to create functional design elements. It is focused on web design but the concepts work perfectly well with print as well. He has other interesting side projects that I will be exploring very soon. Many of these resonate strongly with me.\n\n\n\nstuff i want to dig into deeper\nCreativity as a system by Kazden Cattapan is the sort of thing I really like thinking about. My interests always seem to fall back to the nuances of the creative process. I haven’t incorporated these ideas into my maps of concepts yet but will be diving in soon…I hope.\nLab Notes by Alexander Obenauer is a collection of thoughts and processes related to personal computing and the “operating system of the future”. So many good things related to computer science but also how we use our technology. The site is pretty well designed too.\nSpline looks to be an intriguing 3D modeling app that marries collaboration and functional tools together into an easy to use system. I’m currently teaching 3D modeling using the overwhelmingly complex beast known as Autodesk Maya. I like these smaller projects moving the tools forward in simpler ways. You aren’t going to make Avatar with this but you might still be able to create cool interactive pieces for web or an app.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisual inspiration\nThis Geometric Primes series of posters by Nicholas Rougeux is so visually captivating. He’s working with a simple mathematical setup to create neat visual forms. The ordered approach satisfies my designer side and the visual variations make my artist side happy.\n\n\nNicholas has so many more exceedingly cool projects on his site. Many projects have posters you can order. If only I had the money and wallspace to buy all of them.\nI find the softly surreal images of Lucas Burtin to be captivating.
