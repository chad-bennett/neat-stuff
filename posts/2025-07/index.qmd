### web design stuff

[web.dev](https://web.dev) have free online courses covering the basics of [html](https://web.dev/learn/html) and [css](https://web.dev/learn/css). We are starting coding soon in the Introduction to Web Design course I teach and these are going to be solid reference sites. There are also good courses on things like [images](https://web.dev/learn/images), [responsive design](https://web.dev/learn/design), and [javascript](https://web.dev/learn/javascript) but I'm sticking with just html and css for now.

[32 bit cafe](https://32bit.cafe) is an [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) community of web designers and hobbyists.
